Poe: Write freely.
==================

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d81ae0040343476badac5d003025c784)](https://app.codacy.com/app/sanketsaurav/poe?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=sanketsaurav/poe&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

Poe was born out of our need for writing short blurbs of text that are not long (or important) enough to go on the blog,
but could not fit in a social media post either. It's heavily inspired from [bold.io](https://bold.io), and is supposed to be
an open-source alternative for the same, which anyone can install on a custom domain.


Installation
------------

The preferred way to install Poe is using Docker. Here's how.

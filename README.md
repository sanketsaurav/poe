Poe: Write freely.
==================

Poe was born out of our need for writing short blurbs of text that are not long (or important) enough to go on the blog,
but could not fit in a social media post either. It's heavily inspired from [bold.io](https://bold.io), and is supposed to be
an open-source alternative for the same, which anyone can install on a custom domain.


Installation
------------

The preferred way to install Poe is using Docker. Here's how.
